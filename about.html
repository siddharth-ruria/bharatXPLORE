            <p>hi, i am siddharth. <br /></p>
            <p>i'm from dehradun, india. <br /></p>
            <br />
            <p>
              at the time of making this project, im currently 2 months away
              from graduating. im still not completely proficient in
              web-technologies,<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              but i have made this project to test myself, and didnt take any
              external help (ofcourse except for surfing internet for doubts and
              stuff).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              i also do competitive programming for fun, because, well, i just
              like it!<br />but it drains me so much, both mentally and
              physically (believe it or not).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              i really like the idea of being a good engineer and also a
              successful one someday. i realized a lot late that i really like
              programming, <br />
              no matter how many people think otherwise about this field. i just
              want to build products and engineer stuff and help people through
              it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              i still love football. also music. these 2 things have played a
              crucial role throughout my college years.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              i think code has become my life now. i spend all my days in front
              of my computer, basically grinding away until retirement <br />
              (which feels like forever from now). but hey, that's the plan! to
              keep hustling, keep building, and hopefully <br />
              one day i would have a killer business that lets me chill out.
            </p>
